# 🚀 SIMPLE HOSTINGER UPLOAD GUIDE (Shared Hosting)

## 📁 Files to Upload (EASY METHOD)

Since your Hostinger plan doesn't have Node.js, we'll use the static files from your `.next` folder.

### 🎯 Upload These Folders to `public_html/`:

1. **`public/`** folder (entire folder - contains images, icons, favicon)

### 📄 Upload These Files from `.next/server/app/` to `public_html/`:

2. **Copy content from** `.next/server/app/page.html` → rename to `index.html`
3. **Copy content from** `.next/static/` folder → upload to `public_html/static/`

### ✨ Alternative: Use GitHub Pages (Super Easy!)

Since static hosting can be complex, here's an easier solution:

#### Step 1: Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
git push origin main
```

#### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Settings → Pages
3. Source: Deploy from branch
4. Branch: main
5. Folder: / (root)
6. Save

#### Step 3: Access Your Site
Your site will be live at: `https://yourusername.github.io/student-tools/`

## 🌟 RECOMMENDED: Use Netlify (Free & Easy!)

### Step 1: Go to Netlify
1. Visit https://netlify.com/
2. Sign up with GitHub

### Step 2: Deploy from GitHub
1. Click "Add new site"
2. "Import from Git"
3. Choose your repository
4. Deploy settings:

   - Publish directory: `out`
5. Click "Deploy"

### Step 3: Custom Domain
1. In Netlify dashboard → Domain settings
2. Add custom domain: `campustoolshub.com`
3. Update DNS to point to Netlify
