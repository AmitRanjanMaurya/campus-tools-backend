# Student Tools Platform - Error Prevention & Troubleshooting

## Common Issues and Permanent Solutions

### 1. 500 Internal Server Errors (Static Resources)

**Problem**: `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 (Internal Server Error)` for static assets.

**Root Cause**: Next.js cache corruption during development, especially when making frequent changes.

**Permanent Solutions Implemented**:

#### A. Enhanced Package Scripts
```bash
# Clean development start (recommended)
npm run dev:clean

# Regular development start  
npm run dev

# Clean build
npm run build:clean

# Manual cache cleanup
npm run clean
```

#### B. Batch File for Windows Users
Double-click `dev.bat` to start a clean development environment automatically.

#### C. Improved Next.js Configuration
- Enhanced webpack optimization
- Better chunk splitting to prevent module loading issues
- Improved source maps for debugging
- Fallback configurations for missing modules

#### D. Middleware for Static Asset Handling
- Proper caching headers for static resources
- Security headers to prevent common issues
- Better error handling for API routes

### 2. Module Loading Errors

**Problem**: `TypeError: __webpack_modules__[moduleId] is not a function`

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Webpack optimization with proper chunk splitting
- Vendor chunk separation to isolate third-party modules
- Fallback configurations for Node.js modules

### 3. Cache-Related Build Errors

**Problem**: Webpack cache corruption causing build failures

**Solutions**:
- Automatic cache cleanup scripts
- Process management to kill hanging Node.js processes
- Clean restart procedures

## Development Workflow

### Recommended Development Commands

1. **First Time Setup**:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev:clean
```

2. **Daily Development**:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. **When Encountering Errors**:
```bash
npm run dev:clean
```

4. **Before Production Build**:
```bash
npm run build:clean
```

### Troubleshooting Steps

If you encounter any errors:

1. **Stop the development server** (Ctrl+C)
2. **Run clean restart**: `npm run dev:clean`
3. **If issues persist**: Delete `node_modules` and run `npm install`
4. **For Windows users**: Use `dev.bat` for automated cleanup

### Error Prevention Best Practices

1. **Use clean restart when switching branches**
2. **Don't manually edit files in `.next` directory**
3. **Restart development server after installing new packages**
4. **Use the provided scripts instead of manual `next dev`**

### Project Structure Optimization

The following directories are automatically managed:
- `.next/` - Next.js build cache (auto-cleaned)
- `node_modules/.cache/` - Package cache (auto-cleaned)
- `.turbo/` - Turbo cache (auto-cleaned)

### Emergency Recovery

If all else fails:
```bash
# Complete reset
rm -rf .next node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run dev:clean
```

### Performance Monitoring

The enhanced configuration includes:
- ✅ Optimized CSS compilation
- ✅ Better source maps for debugging
- ✅ Improved chunk splitting
- ✅ Security headers
- ✅ Proper cache management

### Support

All error prevention measures are now built into the project. The 500 errors should no longer occur during normal development.
