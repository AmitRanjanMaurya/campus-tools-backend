## 🚨 Issues Found in Your Campus Tools Hub:

- **Build process**: No more configuration conflicts
- **Image optimization**: Properly configured

### 🚀 DEPLOYMENT RECOMMENDATIONS:

Since your Hostinger **doesn't support Node.js**, here are your best options:

#### Option A: Vercel (RECOMMENDED - FREE)
**Benefits**:
- ✅ Free hosting with professional features
- ✅ All your app features work (API routes, auth, etc.)
- ✅ Automatic deployments from GitHub
- ✅ Custom domain `campustoolshub.com` support
- ✅ Built-in SSL certificates
- ✅ Global CDN for fast loading

**Steps**:
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect to Vercel
3. Deploy automatically
4. Point domain to Vercel

#### Option B: Netlify (ALSO FREE)
**Benefits**:
- ✅ Free hosting
- ✅ Automatic builds
- ✅ Form handling
- ✅ Easy domain setup

#### Option C: Create Static Version for Hostinger
If you insist on using Hostinger, I can create a simplified static version, but you'll lose:
- ❌ API routes (AI features)
- ❌ Authentication system  
- ❌ Dynamic features
- ❌ Blog admin panel
